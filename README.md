# Titanic Survival Analysis with Python & NumPy
Titanic Survival Analysis with Python &amp; NumPy This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python and NumPy. The goal is to practice core data analysis skills, including array manipulation, indexing, random number generation, and statistical calculations.

## Dataset
- [link]([TDI-python-week3-dataset--Titanic Analysis).csv](https://github.com/SusanAlisa/Titanic-Analysis/blob/main/TDI%20PYTHON%20-%20WEEK%203.ipynb))
- Contains passenger details including Survived, Fare, and other attributes

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- CSV
  
## Project Tasks
Extracted the Fare column and calculated:
- Minimum fare
- Maximum fare
- Mean fare

Practiced array indexing on a 2D array (first row & first column).

✔Created a NumPy array with random numbers and found the maximum value.

✔Converted the Survived column into a NumPy array

## Results
- Minimum Fare: 0.0
- Maximum Fare: 512.33
- Mean Fare: ~33.0
